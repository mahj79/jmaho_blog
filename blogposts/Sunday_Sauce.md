Sunday sauce. If you read my welcome post, you may have noticed that I mentioned how homemade pasta sauce is tastier, cheaper, and not much harder to make than simply buying store-bought sauce. Well, good news, this post is dedicated to homemade pasta sauce! If you're wondering where the title "Sunday Sauce" comes from, it's a commonly used term for family-style dinners on Sundays. The weekend is the perfect time to make this sauce because it takes a little longer to cook. I actually made this sauce just last Sunday for my fiancée and a friend, so the name fits perfectly.

I should preface this by saying that this post isn’t just a recipe to follow. You certainly can follow along, but don’t expect a "skip to the end" option after a lengthy life story like you might find on most recipes you Google. This post is simply about how I go about preparing the sauce and turning it into a meal for myself and others.

So, where do we start? This is a red sauce, and while I do have a recipe for a white sauce, I usually make red sauce. I should note that most of the spices listed are ones I already own, so I didn't factor them into the overall cost of this meal since I typically have them on hand. Here’s what you’ll need from the store if you don’t already have some of these items at home:

- Your choice of noodle - Spaghetti is my usual pick, but most noodles will work. I recommend DeCecco pasta, though that’s just personal preference.
- 28 oz can of whole tomatoes - Make sure the tomatoes aren’t drained because you’ll be using everything in the can.
- Fresh garlic - The more, the better. I’ve experimented with 2 or 3 cloves, but 4 or 5 cloves seem to be optimal.
- Your choice of protein  – Italian sausage or meatballs work best. If you have the time, homemade meatballs are fantastic, but buying Italian sausage is easier and still tastes great.
- One half of a sweet onion.
- Spices and bases – Olive oil, unsalted butter, Italian seasoning (oregano works too), crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper.
- Choice of vegetable - dealers choice here but I like roasted broccoli. If you’re going this route, you’ll also need salt, pepper, Spike (if you don’t own Spike, buy it—you’ll thank me later), garlic powder, and Lawry’s seasoning salt.
- Parmesan cheese - cheese
- Wine (Optional) - – A dry red works well, and it’s also a great catalyst for some music and maybe a bit of dancing in the kitchen.

Hopefully, you already have most of the spices and essentials like olive oil and butter, so it shouldn’t be a big trip to the grocery store. For reference, I live in Chicago, so maybe my groceries are a little more expensive compared to other areas, but since I usually look for deals and use coupons, this meal really shouldn’t cost more than $20.

Once you’ve got all your ingredients and are ready to start cooking, begin by chopping up your onion and mincing your garlic. A tip to make mincing easier: flip your knife on it's side and use the knife's blade to crush the garlic against the cutting board. Then, heat three tablespoons of butter mixed with olive oil in a large pot until the butter stops foaming. Add the onions to the pot and let them cook for a few minutes before adding the garlic. Mix them together, and once the aroma starts filling your kitchen, add the can of whole tomatoes—juices and all. Use a potato masher to crush the tomatoes in the pot until they’re all separated.

Stir everything in the pot and season with Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. If you’re unsure about the salt, remember that more is usually better. Let the sauce simmer on low to medium heat for about 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the sauce is simmering, you can work on the rest of the meal.

Preheat your oven to 400°F. While it’s preheating, wash and cut your broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Cover a baking pan with aluminum foil and add a light layer of olive oil to prevent sticking. Place the broccoli on the pan and season with olive oil, salt, pepper, Spike, garlic powder, and Lawry’s seasoning salt. Start boiling water for your pasta (don’t forget to add salt), and put the broccoli in the oven to roast until you see the ends browning.

Once your water is boiling, add your pasta and cook until it’s al dente. As the pasta cooks, begin preparing your protein. If you’re using Italian sausage, cook it until it’s completely browned and cooked through. I like to break mine up into smaller bits, but if you prefer larger chunks, just make sure it’s thoroughly cooked.

By this point, everything should be cooking and nearly ready. Your pasta should be close to done, the broccoli should be browning, the sausage should be cooked, and the sauce should be nice and saucy. Taste the pasta and add salt if needed—you’ll know if it does—and get ready to put everything together.

Drain your pasta, pull the broccoli out of the oven, and mix the sausage directly into the sauce. You can also mix the pasta into the sauce, but I prefer to keep them separate and pour the sauce on top when serving. Plate everything up, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and enjoy your meal!

There are few things better than a delicious meal shared with friends or family. Next time you have some time to prepare dinner, invite a friend or two over, maybe some family, and try this dish. If you give Sunday Sauce a try, let me know how it turns out! Cheers!
