Sunday sauce. If you read my welcome post you may have noticed that I stated homemade pasta sauce is tastier, cheaper, and not much harder to make than simply buying store bought sauce. Well good news, this post is dedicated to homemade pasta sauce! If you’re wondering where the title “Sunday Sauce” comes from, I believe it’s a commonly used term for family style dinners on Sundays and the weekend is the apt time to do so because the sauce takes a little longer to cook. I did happen to make this sauce this most recent Sunday for my fiancee and friend so the name does check out. 

I will preface that this post isn’t intended to just be a recipe to follow. You certainly can follow along, but there won’t be a skip to the end option after reading about some life story like you find on most recipes you google. This post is simply how I go about preparing the sauce and turning it into a meal for me and others. 

So where do we start? For starters this is a red sauce, I do have a different recipe for a white sauce but majority of the time I tend to make red sauce. I will caveat that the majority of the spices listed I already own so I did not factor them into the overall cost of how much this meal cost as I typically always have them on hand. For ingredients you’ll only need a handful of things from the store if you don’t already some at home:


- Your choice of noodle - I typically go with spaghetti, though most noodles will work in this case. I recommend the DeCecco pasta but that’s just personal preference.
- 28 oz can of whole tomatoes. Make sure the tomatoes aren’t drained, you’ll be using everything in the can.
- Fresh garlic. More is better here. I’ve tried around with anywhere from 2 or 3 cloves of garlic, but I’ve found 4 or 5 cloves is optimal.
- Your choice of protein - Few different options here, my recommendation would be italian sausage or meatballs. If you have the time to make meatballs I would opt for that, however buying italian sausage and cooking it is easier and still tastes good.
- One half of a sweet onion.
- Spices and bases - Olive oil, unsalted butter, Italian seasoning (oregano is fine too), crushed red peppers, salt, and pepper.
- Choice of vegetable - dealers choice here but I like roasted broccoli in the oven. For the sake of this meal, I’ll be including steps for making this kind of broccoli. Spices for the broccoli should include: salt, pepper, Spike (if you don’t own Spike, buy it. Thank me later), garlic powder, and Lawry’s
- Parmesan cheese - cheese
- Wine (Optional) - A dry red or any red will really do. - note wine is a great catalyst for enjoying some  music and maybe a bit of dancing while cooking 

Hopefully you have all of the spices and things like olive oil and butter so it’s not a huge trip to the grocery store. For reference, I live in Chicago so maybe my groceries are a little more expensive compared to other areas, but since I usually look for deals and use coupons this really should never cost more than $20.

Ok you have all your ingredients and you’re finally ready to start cooking. Here’s the timeline of steps I usually follow with rough estimates of time for each step:

Chop up your onion (2 mins)
Mince your garlic (2 mins) - note the tip to make this easy is to use a knife with a larger blade that you can crush the garlic with against the cutting board
Heat 3 tablespoons of butter, mixed with olive oil in a large pot till the butter stops foaming (2 - 3 mins)
Throw the onions in the pot and let them cook for 2 or 3 minutes. Then throw the garlic in and mix them together (2 - 3 mins)
Once the onion and garlic starts to produce a nice aroma that fills up your kitchen you’ll want to throw the can of whole tomatoes in the pot, including the juices. The tomatoes are still whole so what you’ll want to do is take a potato masher and crush up the tomatoes in the pot until they are all separated (1 min)
Stir up everything in the pot and add the following: italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper - if you don’t know how much salt to put in, know that more is better (1 min)
This should cook for 30 - 35 minutes, gradually stirring every few minutes or so on low to medium heat. The following steps will be for the rest of the meal and will be notated for when they should be taken in parallel to the sauce cooking so everything is done at the same time
Preheat your oven to 400. While preheating, wash your broccoli and cut up to bite sizeish pieces (3 mins)
Put aluminum foil over a baking pan, put down a light layer of olive oil so the broccoli doesn’t stick. Put the broccoli on the pan and season with the following: olive oil, salt, pepper, Spike, garlic powder, and Lawry’s (3 mins)
Start boiling your water (please add salt to the water) and the put the broccoli in the oven and let it cook until you can see the ends browning (20 - 25 mins)
Once your water is boiling, add your pasta and cook till al dente (10 - 12 mins)
Begin cooking your protein, in the case of italian sausage you’ll want to cook until completely browned and cooked all the way through. I like to break mine up to smaller bits but if you prefer larger chunks, just make sure it’s cooked all the way through (8 - 10 mins)
Everything should be cooking and close to done at this point. Pasta almost done, broccoli browning, sausage cooked, and sauce saucy. Taste the pasta and salt if needed (you’ll know if it needs salt) and prepare to put it all together!
Drain your pasta, pull the broccoli out of the oven, and mix the sausage directly into the sauce
Secondary option is you can mix in your pasta to the sauce as well. I prefer to have them separate and to put the sauce on top
Put everything on your plate and eat up! 

There are a few things better than a delicious meal with friends or family. Next time you have enough time to prepare dinner, invite a friend or two over, maybe some family, and prepare this dish. If you end up giving Sunday Sauce a try let me know how it turns out! Cheers!
