Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my first official blog post! I appreciate you visiting my blog and hopefully you'll enjoy some of the thoughts I jot down that pass through my head. 

I created this blog for two different reasons. First, I wanted to try building a more mobile friendly website compared to the site I built prior: https://jack-mahoney.com (yes I know it's still not very user friendly for mobile but feel free to check it out on desktop). Second, I want to try documenting my thoughts more often and what better place to do that then my own home built website! 

What you can expect is a range of topics such as why homemade pasta sauce is tastier, cheaper, and not that much harder to make than any store bought red sauce. Anything and everything Michigan State Sports, as well as Detroit sports like how the Tigers don't give Reese Olson enough run support. Why checking in on people close to you and taking proactive steps for your mental health is important. Why is my French Bulldog Cleo so cute. Random tech stuff that I may be working on or have an opinion on. The point is the topics could be anything and hopefully you get some entertainment from the random mumbo jumbo I put on this website.

If you have any suggestions on things you want to see me write about for whatever reason, feel free to send them my way! Once again thanks for visiting and welcome along for the ride. Don't forget to come back every once in a while to check for new posts!
