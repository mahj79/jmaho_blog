I was trying to think of things I could write about for my second blog post and kept coming back to the same thing. Check in on people and see how they're doing. It may seem like a simple act but sending a text that says "hey how you been?" or "haven't caught up in awhile, you doing ok?" or even giving someone a call can mean a lot more to the person you're reaching out to than you realize. 

Often times it is easy to get lost in the burn and churn of a week. There's work, hobbies, chores, spending time with significant others, and a million other things going on. That being said it's all too easy to have the days fade into weeks and weeks fade into months without taking a few moments to check in with someone you really care about and see how they're doing. I find myself guilty of this at times and every time I remember to finally reach out, I'm glad I did. 

There's a lot going on in this world and it's easy to forget everyone is going through something whether it seems big or small to you, it matters none the less. While you may not be a licensed professional when it comes to helping folks deal with all their problems, I typically feel a little relieved when someone close to me is kind enough to let me get something off my chest. And hey, sometimes there may not be anything at all to talk about and that's ok, but at the very least you just let that person know that you were thinking about them and showed you care.
